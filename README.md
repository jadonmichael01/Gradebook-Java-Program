# Gradebook-Java-Program
A Programming Assignment for my FIU programming class
For this java program I implemented a program that stores a user's input of grades and students,
which calculates and presents the statistics of grades.
Implemented program input handling phase
Implemented program command handling phase

List of commands:
- min score: Your program must calculate and print the minimum score of all students as the response to this command.
- min letter: Your program must calculate and print the minimum letter-grade of all students as the response to this command.
- max score: Your program must calculate and print the maximum score of all students as the response to this command.
- max letter: Your program must calculate and print the maximum letter-grade of all students as the response to this command.
- letter XXXXXXX : Your program must find and print the letter-grade of the student whose PID is given by the command (XXXXXXX is the PID where each X represents a digit).
- name XXXXXXX: Your program must find and print the full name of the student whose PID is given by the command (XXXXXXX is the PID where each X represents a digit). Full name is made of first name, followed by a single white space and the last name.
- Please enter the information of the next student using the same format. If there is no more students, please enter the keyword “DONE”.Press Enter when you are done.
- change XXXXXXX YY : Your program must find and update the grade of the student whose PID is given by the command (XXXXXXX is the PID where each X represents a digit). Int this command, YY is the symbol for the new grade.
- average score: Your program must calculate and print the average score (out of 100) of all students as the response to this command.
- average letter: Your program must calculate and print the letter-grade of average score of all students as the response to this command.
- median score: Your program must calculate and print the median score of all students as the response to this command.
- median letter: Your program must calculate and print the letter-grade of median score of all students as the response to this command.
- tab scores: Your program must print the list of all students in the form of a tab- separated table containing four columns with labels first name, last name, PID, and score.
- tab letters: Your program must print the list of all students in the form of a tab- separated table containing four columns with labels first name, last name, PID, and letter-grades.
- quit: Your program must stop asking for more commands and quit.
